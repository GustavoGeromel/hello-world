Just another repository

Hello!

My name is Gustavo, I'm studying system analysis and development, my course is EAD.
I'm in the 3rd semester. But only now I decided to learn how to use GitHub. 
Because with so much information, I stayed confused and same with help, I needed to 
start alone to learn better.
